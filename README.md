## How to use:

It's pretty simple to use, just download the folder and open EmailAutomation.py in whatever IDE you want, I like to use Thonny for Python.
<br /><br />
You will see three fields that need to be filled in: toList, email_sender, email_password. 
<br /><br />
Make sure you move the file you want the program to read into the same folder that you downloaded earlier. To quickly locate the path for your file, simply open your computer's terminal and drag the file into your terminal. I know this works on Mac and I believe it works on Windows as well. This should give you the most accurate path to your file. You can then copy that path into `toList = buddyPairing('Insert File Name')`. 
<br /><br />
Make sure 2-step verification is enabled for your email account (Google-based) so that you can create an app-specific password to use in the program.
Once that's done, all you need to do is to fill in `email_sender = 'Insert Sender Email'` with your email and `email_password = 'Insert Sender Email Password'` with the password generated from the app-specific password and run the code. Please note that the email you put for email_sender will be visible to recipients.

## Disclaimer:

This was a rushed project so there may be a few errors, as far as I know, the code still works. I might come back and update it as necessary.
