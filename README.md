## How to use:

It's pretty simple to use, just download the folder and open EmailAutomation.py in whatever IDE you want, I like to use Thonny for Python.
<br /><br />
You will see three fields that need to be filled in: toList, email_sender, email_password. 
<br /><br />
To locate the path for your file, simply open your computer's terminal and drag the file into your terminal. It should give you the most accurate path
to your file. You can then copy that path into `toList = buddyPairing('Insert File Name')`. 
<br /><br />
I would recommend turning on 2-step verification for your email account (Google-based) so that you can create an App-specific password to use in the program.
Once that's done all you need to do is to fill in `email_sender = 'Insert Sender Email'` and `email_password = 'Insert Sender Email Password'` and run the code.

## Disclaimer:

This was a rushed project so there may be a few errors, as far as I know, the code still works. I might come back and update it as necessary.
